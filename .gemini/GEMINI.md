# AGENTS.md: Visual Apache Beam/Dataflow Designer (VS Code Plugin)

## Project Overview & Purpose

* **Primary Goal:** The primary goal of the project is to create a VS Code plugin that gives users a drag-n-drop experience when designing beam and DataFlow jobs.  Once the user defines the agent, this project will use Gemini to generate a code base  that follows best practices and can be deployed, commited to source control, and edited. (editing code will be overwritten if you use the designer to generate code again.)


This document provides essential context for AI models interacting with the `agent-designer` codebase.

## Model Selection & Rules
- **CRITICAL RULE**: Never revert to or map model names to `gemini-2.5` (`gemini-2.5-flash`, `gemini-2.5-pro`) or Gemini 1.x/2.x. They are deprecated.
- **Valid Models**: Use `gemini-3.7-flash` (Recommended)
- **Region Configuration for Vertex AI**: `gemini-3.7-flash` on Vertex AI MUST use the `global` region (`location="global"` or `os.environ["GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION"] = "global"`). Regional endpoints like `us-central1` do not host the `gemini-3.7-flash` publisher model and will return 404 NOT_FOUND. Always configure `global` location for model execution.
- **Search Tools & Multi-Tool Delegation**: When an agent uses search grounding (`GoogleSearchTool` or `VertexAiSearchTool`) alongside sub-agents or function tools, you MUST configure `bypass_multi_tools_limit=True` (e.g. `from google.adk.tools.google_search_tool import GoogleSearchTool; GoogleSearchTool(bypass_multi_tools_limit=True)`).
- **Search Tools & Controlled Generation**: Vertex AI Gemini does not support combining tools (`google_search`) with controlled generation (`output_schema`) on the same agent. All Agents should write to state keys instead; only downstream synthesizer agents without tools use `output_schema`.

## Coding Conventions & Style Guide
- **Author Tag**: Add `Mike Nimer <mikenimer@google.com>` as the Author to every class modified.
- **Git Commits**: Never commit code unless explicitly requested by the user. When commiting code include detailed summary of work done.
- **CSS / UI Spacing**: Use the 8pt grid system for all spacing (margins, paddings, sizing in multiples of 8px).
- **TypeScript / React**: Nested components should take props in and emit events up. Avoid unnecessary two-way data binding.  Do not write large files, break the files up into components and helper classes following general best practices for React, Typescript, and code in general. 
- In the generated code, DO NOT add unnecessary/undocumented fallbacks, search the web for documentation or fail fast instead.


## Testing guidelines
   * **New Code:** All new code must have detailed unit tests, for 100% code coverage.   Test should include simple conditions, extreme conditions, and failure conditions. 
   * **Regressions:**  Every bug fix must include a unit test that validates the bug fix. So we never have a regression bug.  


## Architectural Patterns

* **Overall Architecture:** TBD
* **Directory Structure Philosophy:**
    * `/`: The root contains the documentation, vite config, and package dependencity
    * `/src`: Contains the plugin extension source code
    * `/resource`: Contains the prompts, scaffolding examples
    * `/tests` : Contains all unit tests for the plugin.


## Documentation Guidelines

### In-line Code documentation
* **Class Documentation:** Add a description to the top of every class you modify, explaining the purpose of this class and it's job inside the application.   Keep a running list of architectural decisions made in this class OR instructions for the next model session about this class and how it works.
* **Method Documentation:** document every method you modify
* **Code Documentation:** Inside any method, add detailed documentation to
- each section of the code
- detailed comments about the logic flow inside a method.  
- You may use the following tags:  "// TODO:" to denote sections that need further improvement, "// NOTE:" to denote important information, "// HACK:" to denote a workaround, "// FIXME:" to denote something that is broken.
  

### Project Documentation
* `/ARCHITECTURE.md`: Living technical architecture reference detailing system subsystems (Extension Host vs. Webview SPA), Mermaid diagrams, generated code structure, and deep-dive runtime patterns (Universal Agent Adapter and Vertex AI Evaluation). Sync Instructions: Keep in sync on system structure or runtime pattern changes. Update when adding new extension host managers, modifying high-level Mermaid diagrams, altering the structure of the generated target repositories, or changing test harness and evaluation execution flows. Isolated bug fixes or internal method refactors do not require updates.




## GIT guidelines
   * **Never commit code**  User will commit code after reviewing changes. 

   * **Commit Messages:** 
    * Commit messages should be in the format: `<type>: <subject>`
    * Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `chore`
    * After completing a plan, write up a git commit message explaining all of the changes you made.

   * **Branching Strategy:** 
    * **Mainline:** `main`
    * **Development:** `develop`
    * **Feature Branches:** `feature/<feature-name>`
    * **Hotfix Branches:** `hotfix/<hotfix-name>`
    * **Release Branches:** `release/<release-name>`


## Infrastructure as code
   * **Terraform:** Project configuration must be 100% deployed with terraform.   Do not auto-run the terraform, as me to run it after you modify it. 
   * **Security:** Be mindful of security. Do not hardcode secrets or keys. Use the provided Terraform variables for any sensitive information.
